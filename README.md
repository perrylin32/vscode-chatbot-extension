# LeetCode Chatbot README

The **LeetCode Chatbot** is a VS Code extension designed to assist you with solving LeetCode problems directly within your editor. It provides intelligent suggestions, analyzes your code, and helps you improve your problem-solving skills without leaving VS Code.

## Features

1. **Code Analysis and Suggestions**  
   Get actionable feedback on your current code. The chatbot identifies potential issues and suggests improvements to optimize your solution.

2. **Integration with Local AI Models**  
   The extension works seamlessly with local AI models (e.g., Ollama's DeepSeek) to provide real-time assistance.

3. **Lightweight and Easy to Use**  
   No need for external tools or cloud APIs‚Äîeverything runs locally for privacy and efficiency.

4. **Customizable Prompts**  
   Tailor the chatbot's behavior to focus on debugging, optimization, or explanation.

## Requirements

To use this extension, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **VS Code**  
   Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Ollama**  
   Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and pull the required model (e.g., `deepseek-r1:latest`):
   ```bash
   ollama pull deepseek-r1:latest
   ```

3. **Python Backend**  
   The extension communicates with a Flask backend that interacts with Ollama. Ensure you have Python and Flask installed:
   ```bash
   pip install flask requests
   ```

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `leetcode-chatbot.model`: Specify the AI model to use (default: `deepseek-r1:latest`).
- `leetcode-chatbot.backendUrl`: URL of the Flask backend (default: `http://localhost:5000`).
- `leetcode-chatbot.enableDebugLogs`: Enable debug logging for troubleshooting (default: `false`).

You can configure these settings in your VS Code `settings.json` file:
```json
{
  "leetcode-chatbot.model": "deepseek-coder:6.7b",
  "leetcode-chatbot.backendUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
  "leetcode-chatbot.enableDebugLogs": true
}
```

## Known Issues

- **Performance**: Large files or complex prompts may take longer to process.
- **Model Compatibility**: Some models may not support specific coding tasks. Experiment with different models if needed.
- **Local Setup**: Ensure Ollama and the Flask backend are running before using the extension.

If you encounter any other issues, please report them on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo/leetcode-chatbot/issues).
